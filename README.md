### How are you going to approach the problem(abstract)?
Our approach to exploring Kenvenueâ€™s product optimization initiative involves a thorough analysis of select datasets to extract actionable insights. We plan on identifying the high-performing need states, optimizing inventory turnover rates, and enhancing sales channels effectiveness. Our team will leverage both our business acumen and programming skills to develop a solution for Kenvue. 
After briefly reviewing the data in Total Sales, judging by the increase in sales during the colder months of the years (especially during 2021 where the COVID-19 pandemic was still prevalent), we will assume that need state 1 is over the counter cough and flu care products. 

### Who is in your group, and what is the division of labour?
Our team consists of 3 members who will be responsible for the following: 
Data cleansing and integration
Analytics and insights formulation
Programming solutions implementation
Visualization of data and insights 

### Which data set will you use?
We will leverage the following datasets that we feel will best support our project plan: 
Total Sales
Total Trade spend
Customer DC Inventory

### Do you plan to use external data to aid your analysis(references)?
Looking at industry benchmarks and data will support our analysis to validate our findings and provide additional context. SimplyAnalytics will provide us with demographic, business, and marketing data. 

### What technologies are involved (software, packages/libraries, techniques)?
GitHub Repository: We will use GitHub for version control and for collaboration purposes, ensuring a streamlined and organized workflow. The repository link will be submitted via Quercus. 
Programming Language: Python will be our main language for data analysis and solution implementation. 
Packages/Libraries: As of now, Pandas and NumPy will be implemented for data analysis as they are efficient libraries to use when handling large datasets. Matplotlib and Seaborn will also be leveraged in preliminary data visualization of the datasets to give us a clear picture. 
Jupyter Notebook: Our code will be housed in Jupyter Notebooks.
Data Visualization: Final data visualizations will be extracted from Tableau to effectively communicate our findings. 
Presentation: For the final presentation, we will design our slides in Canva/Microsoft PPT
Documentation: We will use Markdown in our Jupyter Notebook for clear documentation of our methodology. A project outline will also be available on our GitHub Repository.
